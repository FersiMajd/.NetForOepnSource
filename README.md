# .NetForOepnSource
this is a repo that will contain a bunch of contributed projects to build apps and libs with .net core for the open source community(Linux), Anyone who wants to learn or share the knowledge can join this repo.

licensing : this must be srious :p no licensing at all am making this repo to bring more tools to us the developers as I believe in sharing and helping and am also fan of Linux I wish it would become the most common OS in all the desktops.

Dev-Env :
everyone can have his own way, just remeber to add in the .gitignore all needed filtering accoding to your ide and context. Tha main focus is to build libs and apps for the linux distros. Personaly I will be using the Ubuntu disto and as IDEs I might switch between Rider and VsCode.
To keep things organized we should start with a master branch for each new project ex: master-project_name,...

About me:
I have been working as .net developer for 6 years now, mainly on internal test frameworks projects for the automotive industry(BMW, Volkswagen, Audi and Porshe).
What I like the most is developing video games, I worked for an off-shore company for 2 years delivering to mobile projects using the Unity3D game engine, so anyone who has something in mind we can collaborate together in that as well yet to mention that I master Cinema4d as well for modeling and animation.
